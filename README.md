NICE-TO-HAVES:

-All:
    *Replace react-pose with pure CSS transitions
    *Use keyframes to make transitions and animations more dynamic

-Main Page:
    * Simple icons next to the words on each button. Requires vertical alignment and image creation
    * Better animation for social icons and certifications, something like a drip effect would be cool
